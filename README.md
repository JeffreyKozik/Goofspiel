The way the game works is each player has 13 cards one with value 1, one with value 2,
            ..., all the way up until 1 with value 3. A prize card is randomly put in front of the
            two players and each player puts one of their cards facedown. Then they flip the card
            and whoever played the higher card wins the prize card. Whoever ends up with the most
            points (where the value of a prize card corresponds to points) wins the game.
